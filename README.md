**NOTE:** I developed this project during my 2023 summer internship at Jotform. I utilized the API and CSS provided by Jotform during the internship but I was not allowed to share them. I transferred the data I could retrieve with the API to a .json file and used Tailwind CSS instead of Jotform CSS
